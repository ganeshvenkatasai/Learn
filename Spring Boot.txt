1️⃣ Core Spring Boot Concepts
✔ Spring vs Spring Boot – Key differences, advantages
✔ Spring Boot Architecture – Auto-configuration, dependency injection
✔ Spring Boot Starters – spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
✔ Spring Boot Annotations – @SpringBootApplication, @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Bean, etc.
✔ Bean Lifecycle & Scope – @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy, Singleton vs Prototype
✔ Dependency Injection (DI) – Constructor vs Setter injection
✔ Profiles in Spring Boot – @Profile, application-dev.yml, application-prod.yml
✔ Spring Boot Properties & Configuration – application.properties vs application.yml

2️⃣ Spring Boot REST API Development
✔ Building REST APIs – @RestController, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @RequestBody
✔ Path Variables & Query Parameters – @PathVariable, @RequestParam
✔ Exception Handling – @ExceptionHandler, @ControllerAdvice
✔ Response Handling – ResponseEntity<T>, HTTP Status Codes
✔ Content Negotiation – JSON vs XML support
✔ Global Exception Handling – @ControllerAdvice

3️⃣ Spring Boot Data Access & JPA (Database Integration)
✔ Spring Data JPA – @Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue
✔ CRUD Operations – JpaRepository, save(), findById(), deleteById()
✔ Pagination & Sorting – Pageable, Sort
✔ Named Queries & Native Queries – @Query, @NamedQuery
✔ Transactions in Spring Boot – @Transactional
✔ Spring Boot with MySQL/PostgreSQL
✔ H2 Database (In-Memory DB for Testing)

4️⃣ Spring Boot Security & Authentication
✔ Spring Security Basics – Authentication & Authorization
✔ JWT Authentication – Secure API with JWT
✔ OAuth2 Authentication – Google, Facebook login
✔ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – @PreAuthorize, @Secured
✔ Security Filters & Custom Authentication Providers
✔ Spring Boot with Keycloak (SSO Authentication)

5️⃣ Spring Boot Caching
✔ Spring Boot Cache Annotations – @Cacheable, @CachePut, @CacheEvict
✔ Caching with Redis – Store API responses in Redis
✔ In-Memory Caching – EhCache, Guava Cache

6️⃣ Spring Boot Microservices
✔ Building Microservices with Spring Boot
✔ Service Discovery with Eureka
✔ API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway
✔ Spring Boot with Kafka & RabbitMQ (Event-Driven Architecture)
✔ Circuit Breaker with Resilience4J
✔ Inter-Service Communication – REST, Feign Client, WebClient
✔ Spring Boot Distributed Tracing – Zipkin, Sleuth

7️⃣ Spring Boot Testing & Unit Testing
✔ Unit Testing with JUnit & Mockito – @MockBean, @InjectMocks
✔ Integration Testing with Spring Boot – @SpringBootTest, TestRestTemplate
✔ Mocking Dependencies – Mockito.when(), thenReturn()
✔ Testing REST APIs – MockMvc, WebTestClient
✔ Database Testing – @DataJpaTest, H2 Database

8️⃣ Spring Boot Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ, WebSockets)
✔ Spring Boot with Kafka – Kafka Producer & Consumer
✔ Spring Boot with RabbitMQ – Message Queuing, Event Processing
✔ Real-Time Event Processing – Kafka Streams, Spring Cloud Stream
✔ Spring Boot WebSockets – Real-time chat applications

9️⃣ Spring Boot Deployment & DevOps
✔ Dockerizing a Spring Boot App – Writing Dockerfile, Building Images
✔ Deploying Spring Boot with Kubernetes (K8s) – Creating k8s deployments
✔ Spring Boot with CI/CD Pipelines – GitHub Actions, Jenkins
✔ Spring Boot in AWS/GCP/Azure – Deploying to cloud platforms
✔ Spring Boot with Config Server – Centralized configuration management

🔟 Spring Boot Performance Optimization & Monitoring
✔ Spring Boot Actuator – Monitoring & health checks (/actuator/health)
✔ Spring Boot AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) – @Aspect, @Around, Logging Interceptors
✔ Spring Boot Performance Optimization – Profiling with JVisualVM, Spring Boot Async
✔ Spring Boot Metrics & Logging – Micrometer, Logback, @Slf4j

🔹 Advanced Topics (For Senior & Architect Roles)
✔ Spring Boot GraphQL – Query APIs using GraphQL instead of REST
✔ Spring Boot Reactive Programming – WebFlux, Mono, Flux
✔ Spring Boot Multi-Threading & Async – @Async, CompletableFuture
✔ Spring Boot API Rate Limiting – Bucket4J, Redis Rate Limiter
✔ Spring Boot Feature Flags – Togglz, FF4J
