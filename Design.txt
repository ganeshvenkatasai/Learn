Understand Requirements – Clarify the problem statement and ask questions.
Identify Core Entities – List the main objects (e.g., User, Post, Message).
Define Relationships – Determine how entities interact (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
Choose Design Patterns – Pick relevant patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
Define Class Diagram – Sketch main classes, attributes, and methods.
Decide Storage Strategy – Choose between SQL, NoSQL, or in-memory storage.
Design APIs – List important methods and input/output details.
Handle Concurrency – Consider locks, queues, and atomic operations.
Ensure Scalability – Plan for caching, sharding, and microservices if needed.
Consider Edge Cases – Handle failures, invalid inputs, and performance bottlenecks.
Discuss Trade-offs – Justify your choices and alternative approaches.
Write Clean Code – Follow SOLID principles and modular design.
Optimize & Improve – Get feedback and refine the design.


1. Requirement Analysis
Clarify scope – Functional & non-functional requirements.
Identify users & actions – Who uses it and how?
2. Identify Core Entities & Relationships
Use case diagrams – Show interactions between users and the system.
ER Diagram – Define entities and their relationships.
3. Storage Choice (SQL vs NoSQL)
SQL – When data has structured relationships (e.g., banking, e-commerce).
NoSQL – When dealing with high-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data (e.g., social media, real-time analytics).
4. API Design (REST vs gRPC vs GraphQL)
REST – Simple, stateless, widely used (e.g., CRUD operations).
gRPC – Efficient, low-latency, for internal microservices.
GraphQL – When clients need flexible queries, avoiding over-fetching.
5. Class Design (OOP Concepts & SOLID Principles)
Encapsulation – Hide internal details, expose only required methods.
Inheritance & Polymorphism – Code reusability and flexibility.
SOLID Principles – Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.
6. Design Patterns (When to Use What?)
Singleton – Ensure only one instance (e.g., Logger, Database Connection).
Factory – Object creation logic (e.g., different payment methods).
Observer – Event-driven updates (e.g., notifications in social media).
Decorator – Add functionalities dynamically (e.g., applying discounts).
Strategy – Select behavior at runtime (e.g., different sorting algorithms).
7. Caching Strategies
LRU Cache – Remove least recently used items (e.g., session storage).
Redis/Memcached – Fast in-memory storage (e.g., reducing DB load).
8. Concurrency & Thread Safety
Locks & Mutexes – Prevent race conditions.
Atomic Operations – Ensure safe concurrent updates.
Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) – Handle distributed requests safely.
9. Scalability Considerations
Load Balancing – Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Sharding – Split database by key (e.g., user ID).
CDN – Cache static content for faster delivery.
10. Logging & Monitoring
Log Levels (Info, Error, Debug) – Identify issues efficiently.
Observability Tools – Prometheus, ELK Stack for tracking performance.
11. Security & Authentication
OAuth/JWT – Secure API authentication.
Rate Limiting – Prevent API abuse (e.g., 100 requests/min per user).
Encryption (AES, RSA) – Protect sensitive data.
12. Edge Case Handling
Handling Failures – Retry logic, circuit breakers.
Timeouts & Graceful Degradation – Ensure system reliability.
Idempotency – Avoid duplicate transactions.




Key Things to Keep in Mind for HLD (High-Level Design) Interviews
1. Understand the Problem Statement
Clarify functional & non-functional requirements.
Identify key use cases and expected scale.
2. Define System Components
Identify major services, databases, caches, queues, and APIs.
Use a block diagram to visualize architecture.
3. Choose the Right Database (SQL vs NoSQL)
SQL – When strong consistency & structured data is needed (e.g., banking).
NoSQL – When handling large-scale, unstructured, or flexible data (e.g., social media).
4. API Design (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)
REST – Simple, stateless, widely used.
gRPC – Efficient, low-latency, good for internal microservices.
GraphQL – When clients need flexible queries.
5. Scalability Considerations
Horizontal Scaling – Adding more servers (e.g., microservices).
Vertical Scaling – Upgrading existing servers (limited by hardware).
Database Sharding – Split data across multiple databases.
Load Balancing – Distribute traffic to avoid overload.
6. Caching Strategies
Redis/Memcached – Fast in-memory caching to reduce DB calls.
CDN (Content Delivery Network) – Store static content closer to users.
7. Asynchronous Processing & Queues
Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) – Handle background tasks.
Event-Driven Architecture – Decouple services using pub/sub models.
8. Concurrency & Rate Limiting
Locks & Mutexes – Prevent data conflicts in concurrent operations.
Rate Limiting (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket) – Prevent API abuse.
9. Fault Tolerance & Reliability
Replication – Store multiple copies of data (e.g., read replicas).
Circuit Breaker Pattern – Prevent system overload by failing fast.
Graceful Degradation – Reduce features instead of complete failure.
10. Security & Authentication
OAuth/JWT – Secure API access.
Data Encryption (AES, TLS) – Protect sensitive data.
DDoS Protection – Use firewalls, rate limiting.
11. Monitoring & Logging
Observability Tools (Prometheus, ELK Stack) – Track system health.
Log Levels (Info, Debug, Error) – Troubleshoot issues efficiently.
12. Trade-offs & Justifications
Always explain why you chose a specific approach.
Compare alternatives and discuss pros/cons.
